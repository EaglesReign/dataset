CMP237 Phil Hofer Dataset for 2/16/15

This dataset contains the first 25 champions from the game League of Legends.

Each entry contains the champion's name, primary role, secondary role, 
attack rating, defense rating, and ability power rating.
These ratings are scaled from 1-10 with 10 being the best.
All of these things allow me to filter, map, or reduce.

All champions have a primary role, but not necessarily a secondary role.
